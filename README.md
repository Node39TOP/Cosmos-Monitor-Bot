# Cosmos-Monitor-Bot
## Hello Validator Community,

As a fellow validator, I understand how demanding and time-consuming it can be to manage nodes and stay on top of all the details. I’ve been through it myself — and that’s exactly why I created a tool to make life a little easier for all of us.

Today, I’m excited to introduce my new Telegram bot:

👉 Node39 Cosmos Monitor Bot

⸻

## 🔧 Why I built it:

Running a validator can take up a lot of your time — time that could be spent with your family or on other important things. I developed this bot to help you stay informed and react quickly to important node-related events without having to constantly monitor everything yourself.

⸻

## 📦 Main Features:
    •    Instant missed block alerts
    •    Notifications for new governance proposals
    •    Several quick tools to help you check node status anytime, anywhere

This bot has already gone through internal testing, and it’s now in its user expansion phase (with support for selected chains at the moment).

⸻

## 🙏 A small note:

This is a personal project, and while I strive for accuracy, bugs or issues may happen. If you find any errors or have suggestions for improvement, please don’t hesitate to reach out to me via any contact channel you have.
I’m committed to improving and expanding the bot over time with more features and better stability.

⸻

## 🚀 I truly hope this bot will make a difference and be a helpful tool for you on your validator journey.

Wishing you all continued success! 🌱
